Project: Reversi with Monte-Carlo Tree Search
Main Programming Language: C++
Libraries: 
	At this point, the libraries we will be using are not clear to us except for 
	the potential standard libraries such as:
		- iostream
		- cmath
		- string
		- array
		- cstdlib

	As we progress with the project, we will be able to define a more definite list 
	of libraries used. Thank you!
